# NAME

Catalyst::Model::Curio - Curio Model for Catalyst.

# SYNOPSIS

Create your model class:

```perl
package MyApp::Model::Cache;

use Moo;
use strictures 2;
use namespace::clean;

extends 'Catalyst::Model::Curio';

__PACKAGE__->config(
    class  => 'MyApp::Service::Cache',
);

1;
```

Then use it in your controllers:

```perl
my $chi = $c->model('Cache::geo_ip')->chi();
```

See ["SYNOPSIS" in Curio](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio#SYNOPSIS) as this SYNOPSIS is based on it.

# DESCRIPTION

This module glues [Curio](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio) classes into Catalyst's model system.

This distribution also comes with [Catalyst::Helper::Model::Curio](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst::Helper::Model::Curio)
which makes it somewhat simpler to create your Catalyst model class.

You may want to check out ["Use Curio Directly" in Curio](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio#Use-Curio-Directly) for an
alternative viewpoint on using Catalyst models when you are
already using Curio.

# KEYS

There are several ways to handle keys in your Curio models because
Curio classes can optionally support keys.

## No Keys

A Curio class which does not support keys just means you don't
set the ["key"](#key) configuration.

## Single Key

If your Curio class does support keys you can choose to create a model
for each key you want exposed in catalyst by specifying the ["key"](#key)
configuration in each model for each key you want available in Catalyst.
Each model would have the same ["class"](#class).

## Multiple Keys

If your Curio class supports keys and you do not set the ["key"](#key)
configuration then the model will automatically create pseudo
models for each key.

This is done by appending each declared key to your model name.
You can see this in the ["SYNOPSIS"](#synopsis) where the model name is
`Cache` but since ["key"](#key) is not set, and the Curio class does
have declared keys then the way you get the model is by appending
`::geo_ip` to the model name, or whatever key you want to access.

# CONFIGURATION

## class

The Curio class that this model wraps around.

This is required to be set, otherwise Catalyst will throw
and exception when trying to load your model.

## key

If your Curio class supports keys then, if set, this forces
your model to interact with one key only.

## method

By default when you (per the ["SYNOPSIS"](#synopsis)):

```
$c->model('Cache::geo_ip')
```

It will call the `fetch` method on your ["class"](#class) which will
return a Curio object.  If you'd like, you can change this to
call a different method, returning something else of your choice.
